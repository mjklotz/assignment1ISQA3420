##Executive Summary

The Open Source Software onboarding system will be used by any and all personnel looking at using any external software packages. This system is highly recommended to protect against unauthorized or inappropriate use of external code. This will reduce potential legal troubles for us going forward by not allowing software packages with unfavorable licenses to be introduced. It will also give us the opportunity to use software packages that will benefit the company appropriately.
